## 🐝 hi

welcome! thanks for being here.

if you're reading this, maybe you're thinking about contributing! yay!

be forewarned...

## 🐞 context

this site was built by two people locked down together in lock down.

it's built with gatsby, a static site generator, styled with a material ui custom theme,
and a lot of svg elements mashed together.

there's some wild logic in the background to calculate seat allocation... it is confusing.
follow the link on the `about` page to an excel spreadsheet, if you'd like to understand it.

## 💁‍♀️ examples / inspiration

- there are no tests 🤦‍♂️ lol sorry
- there is no linter 😱
- where are the github actions!
- there's probably a bunch of code that can be refactored
- the 404 page could have some more flair
- overhang seats are hardcoded, and so sometimes off-centre... see 2008
- we use a material ui theme, but still have a layout.css 😥
- what if... people could change the 5% threshold?!
