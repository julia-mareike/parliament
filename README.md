## 🐝 hi

 install pnpm cause i like it
 
 `npm i -g pnpm`
 
 `pnpm i`
 
 `pnpm run develop`
 
 ## 🐌 to-do
 
 - [x] display key of party colours & seats won
 - [ ] hover over seat = display party name?
 - [ ] display party vote percentage per party - on left hand side?
 - [ ] display electorate seats won - somehow, in a not-annoying way
 - [x] hook in saint lague formula - https://github.com/julia-mareike/parliament-builder/blob/master/client/utils.js
 - [ ] refactor calculation formula
 - [x] overhang is wrong... it needs to check overhangs _after_ calculating
 - [x] display seats won based on vote percentage (just console log)
 - [x] update parliament svg with seats won
 - [ ] only update parliament svg when vote percentage === 100%
 - [ ] either display possible coalitions or allow ppl to compile themselves?
 - [ ] add in all the other fringe parties
 - [ ] link parties to policy.nz?
 - [ ] tidy up this darn messy code
 - [ ] decrease size of parliament svg slightly to remove mobile scrolling
 
 ## 🐞 bye
