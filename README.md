## 🐝 hi

 install pnpm cause i like it
 
 `npm i -g pnpm`
 
 `pnpm i`
 
 `pnpm run develop`
 
 ## 🐌 to-do
 
 - display key of party colours & seats won
 - hover over seat = display party name?
 - display party vote percentage per party - on left hand side?
 - display electorate seats won - somehow, in a not-annoying way
 - hook in saint lague formula - refactor? https://github.com/julia-mareike/parliament-builder/blob/master/client/utils.js
 - remember how it works lol... 
 - display seats won based on vote percentage (just console log)
 - update parliament svg with seats won
 - only update parliament svg when vote percentage === 100%
 - either display possible coalitions or allow ppl to compile themselves?
 - add in all the other fringe parties
 - link parties to policy.nz?
 
 ## 🐞 bye
